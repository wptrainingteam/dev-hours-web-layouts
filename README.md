# Developer Hours: Web Layouts

This repo contains examples that were showcased in [Developer Hours: How to build modern web layouts with WordPress blocks](https://wordpress.tv/2024/02/27/developer-hours-how-to-build-modern-web-layouts-with-wordpress-blocks/). It is a child theme of the default Twenty Twenty-Four theme, which must be installed to test.

## Instructions

- Git clone this repo into your `/wp-content/themes` folder.
- On the **Appearance > Themes** screen in your WordPress admin, activate the **Dev Hours Web Layouts** theme.
- Create a new post/page/template in the Block Editor.
- Open the **Inserter**, select the **Patterns** tab, followed by the **Developer Hours** category.
- From there, select a layout pattern that you want to test.
- Have fun!

## Notes

The Grid layouts require the Gutenberg plugin installed and activated. Note that future versions (at the date of this repo going live) are required for two of the layouts:

- **Gutenberg 17.8+:** Required for the _Grid Col/Row Span_ pattern.
- **Gutenberg 17.9+:** Required for the _Grid Interactive_ pattern.

Depending on the version of Gutenberg you're testing, you may need to enable Grid-related features via the **Gutenberg > Settings** screen in the admin.
